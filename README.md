# my coding study within dApp University's YouTube Defi Tutorial

this repo is created to incrementally build my defi-tutorial which is a copy of dApp University's DeFi Tutorial on youtube.
Kudos to him!!!

## Why this repo
I am aiming to copy the code but also add some modifications or new features in the future... I also would like to track my work-effort on here with my commits/pushs to this repo...

## what new features:
nothing yet to show here... In the future I hope.

## what is next?
hope to start over a new project, totally from scratch, with just my codes... Soon.. Or in few months.
